# OBOE: Only Binary Operator Expressions


## About

This is a [toy language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) inspired by the [C ternary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:).

It originated when I was thinking it would be nice to have an equivalent to the C ternary operator for the `switch`  statement, this was then expanded to _why not make everything an operator and eliminate keywords_.

Further to this I arrived at the following guides for implementation:

-	Operators not keywords
-	Binary operators only
-	Only use Standard C
-	Use it as a sandbox for other ideas
